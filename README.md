A simple Python app built with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [sv_ttk](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme).

### Functionality

Takes in two co-ordinates (in decimal form) and calculates the distance between the two points using the [Haversine Distance Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) in Nautical Miles

### Installation

To run this app, you need to install the dependencies first using PIP:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Dependencies
